                <p>London is on <mark>Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</mark> only during winter months.
                    The GMT time zone has the same hour offset (GMT+0) as the Western European Standard Time Zone.
                    When Daylight Saving Time starts, London and the whole of UK are on <mark>British Summer Time (BST)</mark>, which is GMT+1.</p>

                <block>Greenwich was a royal park and palace on a hill to the south of the River Thames, east of London.
                     In 1675 the great race to create accurate maps for navigators had begun and Charles II offered the land to The Royal Society for Britain's first national observatory.
                     Christopher Wren was commissioned to design the domed building and John Flamsteed was appointed the Astronomer Royal.
                     British mapmakers began to set Longitude from Greenwich. In 1884 the International Meridian Conference decided that the meridian passing through the main transit instrument at The Royal Observatory in Greenwich would become the Prime Meridian.
                     Every 15Â° longitude represents one hour's difference in time: (24 x 15 = 360, the degrees of a circle). You can work out the time at every location on earth if you know how many degrees it is east or west of Greenwich.
